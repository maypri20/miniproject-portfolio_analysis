Normalized price trends highlight Asset2 as the strongest long-term performer, while Asset5 faced the
largest drawdown during 2020 but recovered sharply. Asset1 remained stable with low volatility,
providing defensive characteristics.
2. Daily Returns & Correlation Insights
Daily percentage returns were calculated for all assets. The correlation matrix revealed a highly
correlated cluster among Asset2, Asset3, Asset4, and Asset5. Asset1 displayed weak correlations with
others, making it valuable for diversification. A scatter plot between Asset1 and Asset2 reinforced their
low relationship.
3. Portfolio Allocation Behavior
Asset weights shifted over time, with equity allocation increasing significantly in 2021. Grouping weights
by asset family showed a balanced exposure across Equity, Fixed Income, and Alternatives, supporting
a diversified risk structure.

portfolio metrics:
• Annualized Return: 11.89%
• Annualized Volatility: 8.51%
Conclusion
The portfolio demonstrates strong long-term performance with controlled volatility. Diversification
benefits arise from low-correlation assets like Asset1, while high-growth assets (particularly Asset2 and
Asset3) enhance returns. The balanced allocation structure provides resilience, resulting in a healthy
risk–return profile.
